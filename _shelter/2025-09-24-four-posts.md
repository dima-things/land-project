## Structure

Nothing complicated here.
**Four sturdy posts** define a rectangular living space.

Basic dimensions:

* **Dimensions:** 8 feet wide × 8 feet deep
* **Front posts:** 8 feet tall (southern sun)
* **Back posts:** 6 feet tall
* **Slope:** 2:8 (25%)

Rope and tarp provide removable weather protection for the first few months.
Branches, earth, and stone (if present) can form low walls to keep out vermin and insects.

Protection features:

* **North wall:** Built up for warmth
* **South side:** More of a ledge

Eventually (year 2):

* Add two more posts to double the space (16' wide × 8' deep)
* Add a basic metal roof for permanent shelter and rainwater collection

## In Practice

* **8 × 10 tarp:** Protects from above
* **8 × 6 tarps:** Used as walls for privacy or wind protection, especially for the shaded north back wall
* **Bed:** Cot or permanent raised bed frame along the inner north side, with hanging bug net

## Material and Process

* Posts must be buried at least **3 feet deep**
* **6 inches of gravel** at bottom of holes for drainage
* Gravel backfill around the posts as well
* Posts: Two 12-foot and two 10-foot 4"x4" posts from Home Depot (<$20 each)
