Structure:
Nothing complicated here. 
Four sturdy posts that define a rectangular living space. 
Eight feet wide and eight feet deep. 
The front posts, those closest to the southern sun, will be at least eight feet tall. Back posts will be six feet. Resulting in at least a 2:8 or 25% slope.
Rope and tarp will provide removable weather protection for the first few months. 
Branches and earth and stone (if present) can form low walls to keep out vermin and insects. The north wall can be built up more for warmth. South side will be more of a ledge.
Eventually, probably in year 2, I will add two more posts to double the space width wise (16' wide x 8' deep). 
Then, I'll add a basic metal roof for a more permanent shelter and also for rain water collection. 

In practice:
- 8 x 10 tarp - commonly available - protects from above.
- 8 x 6 tarps can be used as walls for privacy or wind protection, especially useful for the shaded north back wall. 
- cot or more permanent raised bed frame along the inner north side, with hanging bug net.

Material and process:
- Posts must be burried at least 3 feet deep.
- 6 inches of gravel at bottom of holes for drainage.
- Gravel backfill around the posts as well. 
- Posts will likely be two 12 foot and two 10 foot 4"x4" posts from Home Depot (<$20 each)
