# Welcome to My Land Project

This site documents my journey creating a secret garden.
All projects start in the mind. 
I have no land. 
But one day, I shall. 

## Purpose

Here I collect ideas and information.
There are three areas: plants, shelter, land.
Plants will list native and exotics plants adapted for [USDA zone 5b]([https://example.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone#:~:text=States%20at%201a.-,Definitions,-%5Bedit%5D)).
Shelter will be all things built for the living space.
Land will track broader property plans and changes. 

## What You Will Find Here

For now:
- Plant lists and growth notes  
- Shelter ideas, materials  
- Irrigation and water management ideation
Eventually:
- Plans and maps of the property
- Progress photos and videos

## Feedback and Ideas

Your feedback and ideas are welcome through the GitHub Issues tab.
